## Scenario
**Adversarial Resilience - Assessing StaticSpeed's Infrastructure Security Posture Report**

Your employer, NuttyUtility, is a company in the technology sector with cutting edge software that is known to be targeted by foreign adversaries and has recently acquired a new company, StaticSpeed. Your job is to assess the security posture of the newly acquired company.

Specifically, your boss wants to know the current status of assets inside the perimeter (desktops, servers, remote access, firewalls, applications). Use the given information about the systems currently in place to understand better the possible vulnerabilities and exposures at this new company.

Upon an initial inspection as part of the acquisition, we suspect these systems have not been kept up to date. There is a likelihood that the servers and desktops at this location are running vulnerable applications and misconfigurations that may lead to compromises either by rogue insiders or external malicious actors. If this is the case, this would be an unacceptable scenario as we plan to combine StaticSpeeds systems with our extended network.

Your goal is to establish what assets are in place, perform a security assessment based on industry security controls and best practices, and execute a vulnerability assessment against servers and desktop assets. The result of this assessment will be a report that you must present to your stakeholders. They will relay your findings to the infrastructure team. Together they will decide if this new company is ready to be integrated or if appropriate controls and mitigations need to be in place before this happens.

## Report Criteria
